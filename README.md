# P1 
This is our program solution for our P1 project, which revolves around medicine errors in nursing homes.

### How to run the program
Please open the word document that is inside this folder. That word document contains a detailed installation guide for GTK+, which is a requirement for the program to run. Our program is only tested on windows, and the guide is made for windows only.
